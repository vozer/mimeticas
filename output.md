title: '[]{#_z2rkku9080c9 .anchor}Tutorial: Getting Started (EN)'
---

1 Installing the programs
=========================

The programs to install on your PC are:

-   Google Backup & Sync

-   Meshmixer

-   PrusaSlicer

-   Blender

1.1 Installing Google Backup & Sync
-----------------------------------

**What for?**

This will allow you to access directly from your PC all the folders of
[[Mimeticaslab]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UqtlX3rxXGM61QZ5BR4mhsCAG9sIDkei)
in Google Drive. In particular, the folder you will use for building the
online repository of accessible 3D models will be [[Modelos
3D]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O5o9vmYJ03_x8HKi-Uzv6ay1slkcFyDl).

*Note: You could also skip this feature and simply access everything
online on your personal Google Drive. To do that, skip to Part 2
directly. However, having Google Backup & Sync will be helpful to copy,
paste and move files more easily.*

**How to do it?**

*Part 1: Installing Google Drive Backup & Sync on your PC*

1.  Go to [[Download Backup &
    Sync]{.underline}](https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/)

2.  Click on the download button

3.  Go to your downloads folder

4.  Click to install on your PC

5.  Follow the required steps of the installer

6.  On your PC, open File Explorer

7.  On the left in your taskbar, click on "Google Backup & Sync"

8.  Login with your Google account

9.  Click "deactivate all synchronizations"

10. Click "next", then "understood"

11. Choose a different folder where to save the data, or keep default
    folder

12. Click "end"

*Part 2: Accessing Mimeticaslab Google Drive folder*

1.  Ask a member of Mimeticaslab to share with you the existing Google
    Drive folder of Mimeticaslab

2.  Go to your Google account and accept the invitation

3.  Go to your Google Drive

4.  On the left, click Shared with me

5.  Click on the folder "Mimeticaslab"

6.  In the top right, click "Add to My Drive"

This will add the Folder to your Drive-Files and synchronize it to your
PC.

1.2 Installing Meshmixer
------------------------

**What for?**

This will allow you to edit the 3D models that were downloaded online
and that need to be sent for 3D printing. It will also be useful to
create customized supports for the 3D models that need it.

**How to do it?**

1.  Go to [[Download
    Meshmixer]{.underline}](http://www.meshmixer.com/download.html)

2.  Click on the download button

3.  Go to your downloads folder

4.  Click to install on your PC

5.  Follow the required steps of the installer

1.3 Installing PrusaSlicer
--------------------------

**What for?**

This will allow you to slice the 3D models that need to be sent for 3D
printing. This means that it will convert all the information about the
3D model and all the settings about how you want to print it (filament
thickness, infill, supports, etc.) into specific instructions for the 3D
printer.

**How to do it?**

1.  Go to [[Download
    PrusaSlicer]{.underline}](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/)

2.  Click on the download button

3.  Go to your downloads folder

4.  Click to install on your PC

5.  Follow the required steps of the installer (without the extras)

6.  Open PrusaSlicer

7.  Click "Next" until the end

1.4 Installing Blender
----------------------

What for?

This will allow you to decimate the file size of 3D Models
significantly. A lot of files you will find in the internet have too
much detail for 3D printing.

How to do it?

6.  Go to [Download Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)

7.  Click on the download button

8.  Go to your downloads folder

9.  Click to install on your PC

10. Follow the required steps of the installer

2 Process 3D Models
===================

ATTENTION: It is very important, that if you start this Process, that
you finish it until the next "SAFE POINT", which is the end of the
Chapter "Gettting the 3D Models". If at any point you decide not to go
on please make sure to delete your progress or mark it as unfinished!

2.1 Before you get the 3D Models
--------------------------------

You have to decide what you want to search for.

There are two options:

1.  The model is already in our "Para buscar en 3D"-List

2.  The model is not in our "Para buscar en 3D"-List

### 2.1.1 Option 1: The model is already in our "Buscar"-List

1.  Open Trello -\> Modelos 3D

2.  Look in the List "Para buscar en 3D" for a object you want to search
    for

3.  Open the card and read the description and what has already been
    done

4.  Continue with the steps to get 3D Models

### 2.1.2 Option 2: The model is not in our "Buscar"-List

1.  Decide which Model you want to search for

2.  Open Trello -\> Modelos 3D

3.  In the List "Tutorial" open the Card "PLANTILLA MODELOS (COPIAR)"

4.  Search for the button "Copy" and click it.

5.  Choose a Name e.g. "Panteon Rome"

6.  Select List "Para buscar en 3D"

7.  Change position to "1"

8.  Close the Card

9.  Open the new card you created in the List "Para buscar en 3D"

10. Click "Labels" on the right

11. Click on "Show all Labels"

12. Deactivate all Labels that dont correspond your model. The Card
    needs to have at least one "Epoca" "Tipo" "Tecnic"-Label

### 2.1.3 The Trello Card

Your Trello Card has following Information:

-   Name

-   Description: What to search for + Google Drive Link to Models
    (Default)

-   A Checklist: All this points have to be completed in order for us to
    see the Model as "finished".

-   Activity: In this area we document everything we do in the process
    of finishing the 3D Model.

-   Members (to the right): Here we can choose who is working on the 3D
    Model. If you decide to work on it click "Join". Now everybody knows
    that you are working on the model and you will get Notifications of
    changes and comments.

-   Additional: You can add additional information like "Checklists",
    "Due Dates" or "Files"

2.2 Getting the 3D models
-------------------------

### 2.2.1 Downloading the 3D models

The most popular websites to download ready-made 3D models are:

-   [[Yeggi]{.underline}](https://www.yeggi.com)

-   [[MyMiniFactory - scan the
    world]{.underline}](https://www.myminifactory.com/es/scantheworld/)

-   [[Sketchfab]{.underline}](https://sketchfab.com/feed)

-   [[Thingiverse]{.underline}](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

-   [[Google](https://www.google.es) (Search "Name+3D
    File")]{.underline}

**What for?**

There are many websites that already have a lot of 3D models ready to be
downloaded. All you need to do is search there whatever you are looking
for.

*Note: You need to search with english keywords, as it is the most
common language on these platforms. Only afterwards try other
languages.*

**How to do it?**

1.  Go to the website (start by Yeggi)

2.  Search for the keywords of what you are looking for

3.  Choose a model that looks good

4.  Click on the download button

5.  Copy the URL link of that model

6.  Paste the link in the dedicated card in Trello

*Note: The files usually are downloaded as ZIP folders. Inside, they
contain the STL file of the 3D model. This is the file you will need.*

#### 2.2.1.1 Licencia Modelo original

In the Link to the original Model find the Licence under which it was
published.\
What for?: Depending on the original licence we also have to adapt our
licence.

### 2.2.2 Making a working folder in Google Drive

**What for?**

For every 3D model, a new folder will be created on Google Drive.
Inside, the subfolder "TMP\_Trabajo" is where all the working files are
found. These are the files that will be modified on Meshmixer, Blender
and PrusaSlicer and eventually sent to 3D printing as tests. The tests
will be repeated as many times as necessary, until the optimized
settings are found and approved.

*Note: There will probably be several versions of files with similar
names, so you have to be clear when naming each file. Tell in the
filename what you did with it. For example:
"Model\_decimated\_0.3percent\_withsupports.stl"*

**How to do it?**

1.  On your PC, go to Google Drive \> Mimeticaslab \> Modelos 3D \>
    Modelos en Trabajo

2.  Copy the template folder "AAA-Archivo-Plantilla"

3.  Paste in the same folder and rename as follows: "Epoca\_Nombre"
    (example: Griega\_Panteon)

4.  Go to your downloads folder

5.  Move the STL file from the downloads folder to the newly created
    folder, and into the subfolder "TMP\_Trabajo"

2.1.2 Finishing up (Checklist and advancing Card)

In the Trello Card check:

-   Carpeta Google Drive hecho

-   3D File STL

-   Enlace Modelo Original

-   Etiqueta Siglo o Estilo

-   Etiqueta Disciplina

ATTENTION: Check first if you actually fulfilled all of the points.

Move the Card of the 3D Model to the List "Para Revisar/Editar (3D)"

**SAFEPOINT**

2.3 Editing the 3D models
-------------------------

### 2.3.1 Decimate filesize with Blender (If File-Size exceeds 10MB)

**A lot of files you will find in the internet have too much detail for
3D printing. They can go up to 200MB or more. In order to later upload
the files to the repository and save disk space we will have to decimate
the detail of the file.**

**How to do it?**

1.  **Open Blender**

2.  **Delete Cube**

3.  **Import the Model (.stl, .obj)**

4.  **Select Model (to focus on the model click ".")**

5.  **Open the Settings-Page with the Wrench**

6.  **Add Modifier (Decimate)**

7.  **Change the Ratio of the Model to between 0.1-0.3**

8.  **Check the Model, if you can see any difference. If not go lower
    with the Ratio.**

9.  **To see the original model without the Decimation click the
    "Screen-Symbol". Activate/Deactivate it to see the changes**

10. **Repeat the steps 7-9 until you are statisfied**

11. **Make sure only the Model is selected**

12. **Export Model as STL**

13. **Activate "Selection only" in the export dialog.**

14. **Export**

### 2.3.2 Making basic edits: inspecting, aligning, scaling

**What for?**

The 3D models downloaded online will need to be edited in Meshmixer to
repair any potential mistakes, choose the size you want, and any other
necessary edit. Meshmixer will also be the place to add customized
support or slice the model if needed.

*Note: For more information, see this 10-step
[[tutorial]{.underline}](https://weareprintlab.com/blog/10-steps-to-getting-started-with-meshmixer-for-3d-printing).*

**How to do it?**

1.  Open Meshmixer

2.  Click "Import"

3.  Choose the STL file to edit

-   **Inspecting**

1.  Go to Analysis \> Inspector

2.  Keep all the settings as default (Hole Fill Mode: Flat fill; Small
    Thresh: 0.01mm)

3.  Click "Auto Repair All" \> "Done"

*Note: If there is any problem, write it as a comment in the dedicated
card in Trello, and leave the 3D model to be fixed. Do not continue
editing.*

-   **Aligning**

1.  Go to Edit \> Align

2.  Keep all the settings as default (Source: Base Point; Destination:
    World Origin / Y-Up; Transformation: Translate and Rotate; Flip
    unticked)

3.  Click "Accept"

-   **Scaling**

1.  Go to Analysis \> Units/Dimensions

2.  Change the X, Y and Z dimensions as necessary

3.  Click "Done"

*Note: The printer has a print area of ​​250 x 210mm with a height of
210 mm. The maximum size of the largest dimension should be 200mm. The
recommended size is 150mm.*

-   **Saving**

1.  Go to File \> Export \> Save in corresponding folder "TMP\_Trabajo";
    File type: STL

2.  Go to File \> Save as \> Save in corresponding folder
    "TMP\_Trabajo"; File type: MIX

### 2.3.3 Making advanced edits: adding customized support

**What for?**

Ideally, the 3D model will need to:

-   Be as flat as possible on the printing bed

-   Have as many little overhangs as possible

Depending on the model, it will require some support.

*Note: Making customized support is a time-consuming process, and varies
according to the size of the model (it is not scalable). Deciding about
customized support will depend on each model's specific features,
whether it requires customized support from the start or whether it can
wait until after the first draft is printed.*

**How to do it?**

2.  Step

3.  Step

### 2.3.4 Making advanced edits: splitting the model

**What for?**

Ideally, the 3D model will need to:

-   Be as flat as possible on the printing bed

-   Have as many little overhangs as possible

Depending on the model, it will require to be split.

*Note: Slicing the model will require to later glue the parts together.
It is not a desirable option and is used as a last resort when adding
customized supports cannot work, or when the size of the 3D model is too
big to be done in a single print.*
